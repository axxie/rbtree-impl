# Red-black tree implementation

A study project that is supposed to contain implementation of the red-black tree
from scratch. The idea is to understand it deeply enough be able to implement
one without peeking into other implementations.

The studying is supposed to be based on the 2-3-4 tree, as it should be done
within the "Data Structures" course in the university. Unfortunately, the fact
that red-black tree is just a representation of 2-3-4 tree is often missed in
university courses, published articles and in text books.
